        <h2>What does JBL even do?</h2>

        <strong>JBL</strong> is an American company that manufactures audio equipment, including loudspeakers and headphones. There are two
        independent divisions within the company; JBL Consumer produces audio equipment for the consumer home market, while the
        JBL Professional produces professional equipment for the studio, installed sound, tour sound, portable sound (production
        and DJ), and cinema markets. JBL is owned by Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of South Korean company
        Samsung Electronics.

            <h3>What made JBL so popular?</h3>
        Over the next two decades, JBL went more mass-market with their consumer (Northridge) line of loudspeakers. At the same
        time, they made an entry into the high-end market with their project speakers, consisting of the Everest and K2 lines.
        JBL became a prominent supplier to the tour sound industry, their loudspeakers being employed by touring rock acts and
        music festivals. JBL products were the basis for the development of THX loudspeaker standard, which resulted in JBL
        becoming a popular cinema loudspeaker manufacturer.
